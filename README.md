# Fake-News-Detection
Fake news Detection Using LSTM 
we are going to work on a dataset which consists of 3988 news articles. We will do some text processing and will build a deep learning model which will try to predict whether a particular news is fake or not. This is a Natural Language Processing problem, where we deal with text data and convert texts into some vectors it means a word will be defined as a vector.
